This project was created following the excercises in Sebastin Raschka's book called **Python Machine Learning**.

A multilayer perceptron ML model is trained to recognize hand-written digits. 

# To view some examples of the hand-written digits:
python plot_example_digits.py

# To train the model and see how the cost evolves over time:
python test_mlp.py

You can fine tune the parameters of the model. See Raschka book for definitions of model parameters. The model may take some time to finish, depnding on parameters chosen and hardware speed.
